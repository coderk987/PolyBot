PolyBot
Introduction-
Our chatbot PolyBot is solely based on the concept of learning made fun. As we hope to make learning mathematics an enjoyable experience. We have used algorithms to deliver the best resources for learning and study help, and have used a Gamification Model of practice so as to increase retention, consistency and motivation amongst students.
Features-
 Polybot is a Discord Chatbot, and works on command-based input. This makes it easy to build active and engaging student communities. It also allows for students to initiate group study sessions with ease.
•	Initializing :
1.	Setting Up in PolyBot is a task of ease. Students just have to use the -setup command.
2.	At any time to visit their profile status and track their mathematics study students can use the -pf command to do so.
3.	If at any point students wish to quit from PolyBot Chatbot, they can do so with the -delete command. They can always restart with the -setup command.
4.	The -help command provides a full length guide of PolyBot features, services and commands for new users to get started with.


•	Learning Efficently and Effectively
1.	With PolyBot, students have access to concise and effective resources of all varying concepts in Mathematics. The resources include detailed notes of important concepts, definitions and formulas for any Topic. These can be initiated through the  -study command
2.	PolyBot also features a Study Help Feature, through the -find command. Students can ask any, and we mean any query in the field of mathematics(and beyond).The Bot is capable of answering queries ranging from Arithmetics, Algebra, Calculus, Facts, Definitions, Geometry and featuring much more.
 

•	Gamified Learning commands-
After Learning Mathematical Concepts, one would wish to practice those concepts. But Fear Not, PolyBot also provides its Practice Features and that to in a fun manner. Via GAMIFICATION! We have opted this method as not only does it make Education a task of enjoyment, but it has been scientifically proven to increase Retention, Consistency and Motivation among Students. PolyBot features 2 Game Modes the Race and the Duel.
1.	Racing (Started through the -race command):
Racing Game, is a game where one student can challenge another in this arithmetic game. The Bot presents you with a race track with two cars and then asks you mental maths question. The first one to answer these questions results in their car moving forward. The game also includes the “nitro” powerup which provides a boost to a users car. However the nitro powerup is a one time use and may fail on a wrong answer.
2.	Duels (Started through the -duel command): 
The Duel game is a game where a student gets put into a boss battle with a dragon. Their aim is to defeat the dragon by damaging it but they need to be cautious of the dragons attacks. After presenting the user with the game board, PolyBot asks Maths trivia questions (which change in difficulty depending on the users experience with this game). If the user correctly answers them then the boss loses some of its health, but otherwise the boss damages the user. The Duel features 2 upgrades and 1 powerup. The Potion Powerup can heal the user, but is only a one time user. The Sword Upgrade increases the Users damage potential, and the Armor Upgrade decreases the Boss’s damage potential.

3.	Winning Both the Games provides the user with rewards in the form of Exp and Coins.

4.	Users can check the leaderboard through the -lb command. The leaderboard shows the top Players in these Maths Games, on the basis of the EXP Points earned through these games.

5.	PolyBot also has an inbuilt marketplace where they can buy the aforementioned Powerups(Nitro and Potion) and Upgrades(Sword and Armor) through the coins earned in these games.
